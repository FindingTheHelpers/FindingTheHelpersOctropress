## What?

Finding The Helpers strives to be a website that finds and shares stories of those helping
to make the world a better place. It is a completely open source project that anyone can
contribute to, whether it is a story, video, feature, etc. 

## Who?

Currently, Finding The Helpers is a project by myself, [Justin Carmony](http://www.justincarmony.com "Justin Carmony's Website"), as a place to document the
many stories of people helping other people. I work for [Deseret Digital Media](http://www.deseretdigital.com) on 
the [Deseret News](http://www.deseretnews.com/) team.

## Why?

#### Short Version

I believe that there are more good people in this world than people who wish to harm others.
I also believe that the ratio of people who help versus people who hurt is exponentially 
different in the favor of helpers. Unfortunately, those who hurt others and do harm receive
more attention, so we hope this website to help be a counter balance. We hope that people
will help contribute to this project and help recognize just how many people are helping 
others around the world.

#### Long Version

Honestly, this website serves a somewhat theraputic purpose for me. I've always worked
in technology, but recently I joined the Deseret News team to help run their local &
national websites. Working with a news product, I was suddenly much more aware of all
the sad, tragic, and even horrible stories that happen to people every day. 

Then, in October of 2012, my son Marshall was born. It was as if was exposed to a whole new gambet of
emotions becoming a father, and now many of these stories would weigh on me much more.
I specificly remember reading a story about a 5-month-old boy killed by his father in an
attempted murder-suicide. It was the same day Marshall turned 5-months old. I had to 
stand up and walk away from my computer to take a break so I wouldn't start to cry
at work.

Week after week, more stories would come across our website. While not all hit me as
hard as others, I found myself wanting to find a some sort of way to counter balance
all the "bad news". I was greatful that our journalists also like to cover uplifting
stories about people doing acts of service. I remember thinking I should keep a
list of these stories to look back of if I ever needed a little "pick-me-up" whenever
we had a particular sad news day.

On April 15th, 2013, the [Boston Marathon bombing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombings) occured. 
Soon afterwards, the quote from Mister Rodgers at the top of this page, was being shared
around the internet. It was amazing to watch all of the people across the community, nation,
and even world respond with a desire to help.

Just one example were the 6,142 people who, via a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AoXVKFw1Uci5dFNpRGdWd2pXZTN4a3Fza0VhVTRVaGc&output=html), [offered to help people](http://www.boston.com/yourtown/specials/boston_locals_offer_their_homes/) affected by the bombing by offering their homes,
transportation, hot meals, etc. 

So the idea of this website was born. Every few weeks I'd see a story about helpers helping others, 
and I knew I needed to just start this website. It took me several more months to finally take
the time to sit down and start this project.

So here it is, in all it's infancy right now. At the very least, it will be a place
to help me document these stories of "the helpers." But I hope that people will
want to contribute back to the project and help it become a great digital reflection
of the simple reality of Mr. Rodger's statement: there are always people who are helping,
and that is great thing about our world.
