A team of Football players help sophomore Chy Johnson deal with
her bullying problems at school by becoming her friend. <!-- more -->

From parts of the [ESPN article](http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/8579599/chy-johnson-boys) on this story:

> "She'd come home every night at the start of the school year 
> crying and upset," says her mom, Liz Johnson. "That permanent 
> smile she had, that gleam in her eye, that was all gone."
> 
> Her mom says she tried to talk to teachers and administrators 
> and got nowhere. So she tried a whole new path -- the starting 
> quarterback of the undefeated football team. After all, senior 
> Carson Jones had once escorted Chy to the Special Olympics.
>

> Facebook page. "Maybe get me some names?"
>

> I get emailed stories like this a lot, but most of the time 
> they don't pan out. They turn out to be half true, or true 
> for the first week but not the second. But when I walked 
> into the Queen Creek High School cafeteria Tuesday, 
> unannounced, there was 4-foot-high Chy with 11 senior 
> football players, eating her lunch around the most packed 
> lunch table you've ever seen, grinning like it was 
> Christmas morning. It was Carson's birthday, and she'd made 
> him a four-page card. On one page she wrote, in big crayon 
> letters, "LUCKY GIRL."
